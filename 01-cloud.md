# What is cloud 
Before going to the definition, we start with an example. In the past, organizations used to buy servers to deploy an application and were responsible for managing everything, including configuration, security, and so on. They bought different servers for different applications, which not only increased the cost but also created a lot of pressure for maintenance. 
To be more specific, an application would be deployed on a server that has 100 GB storage, but the application requires only 30 GB, and the remaining storage would not be used as one server would deploy only one application. 

From this scenario, the term virtualization arose, and AWS is the first ever organization that started to work on it. Therefore all the large companies move into the cloud instead of setting up . 

## What is Virtualization ?

The way we can recover the wasted resources from a server. Before virtualization, we had to need 50 servers for 50 kinds of applications, but now one server runs 50 applications. One of the best advantages is that we can share it with others .

## Public vs Private Cloud & Hybrid Cloud
Public Cloud: Anyone with an AWS account can create an instance and does not need to worry about where the server is installed.

On the other hand, a private cloud is considered on premises where the organization has to handle everything from maintenance to managing. In contrast , Public cloud service providers ( AWS) manage this type of stuff . 

Hybrid Cloud is a combination of both public and private Cloud.
